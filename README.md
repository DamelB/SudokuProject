# Sudoku project
Final project of Python course.

Lot of functions are not done yet, some bugs as well. For the length of the course I believe all important is done.

One can create a new sudoku via **editor** and load from some **premade** ones.

## TODO
To save the name one has to update the created file **./files/New Sudoku.sdk** to the name of their choice. Feel free to update the description as well, not implemented yet.
