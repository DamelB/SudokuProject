# Sudoku project
Final project of Python course. [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) is required.

One can create a new sudoku via **editor** and load from some **pre-made** ones.
Exported sudoku is file in **./files/New Sudoku.sdk**, user has to rename it themselves,
and they can look inside to adjust the description at the bottom
(more with it isn't implemented atm).

For the length of the course I believe all important is done.
There still might be some minor bugs, i.e. one can't quit during the select Sudoku screen.

## Final thoughts
The decision to use pygame was mainly because I didn't know any better how to handle the input.
For now, I won't continue with this project itself, but I might use it in the future
as a base for same idea within some GUI that works with elements in relative positions.
